\begin{abstract}
%%%%%
The Scalable Observation System (SOS) introduces a new workflow
runtime system (SOSflow) to enable online in situ characterization and
analysis of complex high-performance computing applications.
%
SOS emphasizes a semantic data model with distributed information
management and structured query and access.
%
The primary design objectives of SOSflow are flexibility, scalability,
and programmability, with data being annotated for use in high-level
reasoning about total scientific workflow performance from a variety
of perspectives.
%
SOSflow provides a complete framework that can be configured with and
used directly by an application, allowing for simultaneous semantic
encoding of multiple observation sources as well as analytics modules
that can operate over information provided by any and all contributing
sources.
