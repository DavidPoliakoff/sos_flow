\section{Related Work}
%
Traditionally, HPC research into enhancing performance has been
focused on the low-level efficiency of one application or library, or
some particular machine.
%
The related work mentioned here, and many other performance monitoring
tools, are well-implemented, tested, maintained, and regularly used
for in production and for performance research studies.
%
However, each have deficiencies that render them unsuitable for a scalable
online performance analysis framework.
%
\par
%
Tools like TAUg \cite{huck2006taug} are able to bring HPC developers a closer look into to
their codes and hardware, gathering low-level performance data and
aggregating it for integrated analysis after an application concludes.
%
Low-level metrics can help identify performance bottlenecks, but are
naturally suited for non-production or off-line episodic performance
analysis of individual workflow components.
%
Such deep instrumentation is necessarily invasive and can dictate
rather than capture the observed performance of the instrumented
application when the application is running at scale or required to
engage in significant amounts of interactivity.
%
\par
%
SOSflow provides a model that can accept low-level information such as
what TAUg collects, while also operating over light-weight higher-level
information suitable for on-line operation during production runs.
%
One of our goals, online introspection of workflow performance,
involves unsupervised machine-learning for model development, and the
application of complex classifiers to match observations with models.
%
Doing principle components analysis on \textit{complex unconditioned
  performance data} is computationally expensive and unsuitible for a
runtime environment.
%
SOSflow conditions performance data by annotating it with context and
semantic tags to help efficiently process it during online
introspection.

Cluster monitoring systems like Ganglia \cite{massie2004ganglia} or
Nagios \cite{katsaros2011building} collect and process data about the
performance and health of cluster-wide resources, but do not provide
sufficient fidelity to capture the complex interplay between
applications competing for shared resources.
%
In contrast, the Lightweight Distributed Metric Service
\cite{agelastos2014lightweight} (LDMS) attempts to capture system data
continuously to obtain insight into behavioral characteristics of
individual applications with respect to their resource utilization.
%
%However, neither of these provides a framework that can be configured
%with and used directly by the application, nor allow for semantic
%encoding of multiple observation sources.
%
However, neither of these frameworks can be configured with and used
directly by an application.
%
Additionally, they do not allow for richly-annotated information to be
placed into the system from multiple concurrent data sources per node.
%
\par
%
LDMS provides basic integration of multiple modalities of data in
real-time, triggering program invocation or shaping work allocation
across a cluster as informed by network congestion statistics, and
other hybridized or meta-execution data points.
%
LDMS uses a pull-based interaction model, where a daemon running on
nodes will observe and store a set of values at a regular interval.
%
SOS has a hybrid push-pull model that puts users in control of the
frequency and amount of information exchanged with the runtime.
%
Further, LDMS is currently limited to working with double-precision
floating point values, while SOS allows for the collection of many
kinds of information including JSON objects and ''binary large
object'' (BLOB) data.
%
\par
%
TACC Stats \cite{evans2014comprehensive} facilitates high-level
datacenter-wide logging, historical tracking, and exploration of
execution statistics for applications.  It offers only minimal
runtime interactivity and programmability.
