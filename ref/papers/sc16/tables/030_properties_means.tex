scalable                   / From one to millions of nodes
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

portable                   / Many architectures and operating systems
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
easy to use                / Simple well-degined interfaces,
                             minimal external software dependencies
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
multi-purpose              / Utility not limited to any single
                             component purpose, does not impose
                             a priori purposes for monitoring
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
concurrent with workflow   / Runs at the same time as workflow
                             in order to capture emergent behavior
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
in situ access             / Complete feature set available on-node,
                             allowing distributed and data-local
                             analytics, feedback, and control
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
low overhead               / Do not consume storage, bandwidth,
                             or compute time wastefully, allow
                             system to be [de]activated dynamically
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
low intrusion              / API calls should return rapidly, and
                             users have means to exercise control of
                             storage vs. transport timing trade/offs
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
responsive                 / Timeliness of replies should support
                             application steering and global
                             state interrogation
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

can dedicate resources     / When available, make use of dedicated
                             resources to avoid contention
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
on-line interactivity      / Handle control and introspection
                             messages and replies while
                             workflow is running and SOSflow is
                             continuously operating
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
user-space                 / Do not require administrative
                             privileges for basic functionality
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
database                   / Utilize general-purpose SQL data store
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
HPC-friendly               / Take advantage of high-speed
                             communication fabric unique to the
                             HPC environment.  Do not require
                             components that are not suitable or
                             available for HPC
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
extensible                 / Modular design and APIs to allow
                             feature extension, configurable behavior
%
\hline %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
global information space   / All information is contextualized and
                             distinctly addressable, even if not
                             migrated off-node at run-time
