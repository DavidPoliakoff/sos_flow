\section{SOSflow Architectural Model}
%
SOS contributes a general solution to on-line in situ
observation, introspection, feedback, and control of scientific
workflows.
%
Multi-component scientific workflows provide a focus for the
general challnge of distributed on-line monitoring.
%
Applying the SOS model to the challenge of on-line observation for
complex and highly variable deployments of scientific workflows led to
the creation of the SOSflow runtime software system.
%
\subsection{Core Features}
%
Information from a wide variety of sources can be relevent to the
characterization and optimization of a workflow.
%
\par
%
In order to gather run-time information and operate on it, SOS needs
to be active at the same time and in the same context as the workflow
components.
%
This on-line operation should be able to collect data from multiple
sources within its context and efficiently service requests
for this data.
%
Because information transport technology and methods have such
diversity and case-by-case optimality, SOS must be implemented
independent of the technology used in the scientific workflows it
complements.
%
All information that is captured in SOS should be distinct and carry
with it a set of metadata to enable classification and reasoning over
it.
%
SOS should aggregate necessary information together at run-time to
enable high level reasoning over the entire monitored workflow.
%
\par
%
These SOS requirements inform the features of SOSflow and a frame the
general solution to the challenge of on-line in situ observation,
introspection, feedback, and control.
%
\subsubsection{Online}
%
It is necessary to obtain observations at run time to capture features
of workflows that emerge from the interactions of the workflow as a
whole.
%
Relevant features will emerge from a program's interactions
with its problem set, its configuration parameters, and with the platform on
which it is executing.
%
Making the full functionality of SOSflow available during run-time
also helps with the SOSflow platform's scalability: The work of
observation and introspection is distrubted across the observed
application's resources proportionally, and required performance data
aggegation can run concurrently with the job.
%
\subsubsection{Scalable}
%
Tools and run-time infrastructure need to support the largest scale of
operation that applications are being designed for.
%
SOSflow is being engineered with an eye towards running at exascale
on the next generation of HPC hardware.
%
SOSflow is a distributed runtime environment, with an agent present
on each node, using a small fraction of the node's resources.
%
Running in situ lends SOSflow its natural scaling features: More nodes
mean more compute resources are available to SOSflow in proportion.
%
The node-level SOSflow agents transfer information off node using
the high-performance communication infrastructure of the host cluster.
%
Aggregation of data need not target a single bottleneck, SOSflow can
be configured to support a scaling number of logical aggregation points
in order to provide query access to the global information space at
run-time.
%
\subsubsection{Global Information Space}
     \begin{itemize}
       %
        \item \textbf{Multiple Perspective} - Information gathered from
          applications, tools, and the operating system are captured
          and stored into a common context, both on-node and across
          the entire allocation of nodes.  The different perspectives
          into the performance space of the workflow can be queried
          in a way that includes parts of multiple perspectives,
          helping to contextualize what is seen from one perspective
          with what was happening in another.
          %
        \item \textbf{Time Alignment} - All values captured in SOSflow
          are time-stamped, so that events which occured in the same
          chonological span in different parts of the system can be
          aligned and correlated.
          %
        \item \textbf{Resuable Collection / Unilateral Publish / ???} - ...
