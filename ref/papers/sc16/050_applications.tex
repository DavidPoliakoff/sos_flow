%  Lots of redundant stuff in here given newer writing in
%  earlier sections.
%

%
%  This should probably get swallowed more by the Validation section
%  because that is what I have results for, in terms of gathered
%  performance metrics about the behavior of SOSflow itself.
%
%  The best thing to show here would be screens and a description of
%  the LULESH run on Cori alongside the table of with/without SOSflow
%  walltimes for jobs of various sizes.
%

\section{Applications}
While not favoring any one use more than another, the following applications
were considered with reasoning about the design of SOSflow:
\begin{itemize}
  %
\item \textbf{Resource Constraint Enforcement} : Power,...
  %
\item \textbf{Online Performance Tuning}
  %
\item \textbf{Understanding Complex Workflows}
  %
\item \textbf{Coupling In Situ Interactivity w/Big Data Tools}
  %
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is Observed}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{How to Observe}
%%%%%
A daemon process is launched on node that acts as an intelligent
unbounded asynchronous hub for in situ collection of data from
multiple sources, the migration of that data into searchable stores,
and the targeted delivery of feedback messages from online analytics
modules observing the flow of information.
%%%%%

\subsubsection{``Put the Data Somewhere Useful''}
%%%%%
Because of the variety of metrics of interest, the fact that they may
not always be expressed in any given runtime, and that all possible
metrics are not known a priori to be hardcoded into a system, it is
exceedingly helpful from an architectural point of view if performance
observations are gathered into a common fabric from all sources.
%
Any well-intended program spinning opaque snapshots of its internal
state out into a proprietary database is denying all other parts of
the environment the ability to learn more about each other,
themselves, and that program.
%%%%%


\subsubsection{Simple, Clean, Universal}
%%%%%
Rather than seeing yet another printf()-style instrumentation
dead-end, or a Titanic-scale solution that requires deep federal
pockets or administrator priveleges to use, a well-designed
observation system will provide a clean and flexible interface
suitable for capturing and annotating metrics within their context,
and will bring the metrics from all sources together to be operated
over following a shared set of action-oriented semantics.
%
As users operating with self-interest will be the pioneers seeding
these raw data fields, the system should be easy to use and
accessible, and provide immediate benefit to anyone who wishes to add
some sweat equity.
