\textbf{ptrace} : One-liner about how unreasonably fine-grained this is.
\textbf{TAUg} : Being built into a low-level performance profiling tool, limits utility
\textbf{Caliper} : I probably want to talk about Caliper more.
\textbf{Cache} : I could reference Cache as a way of describing the tech I used.
\textbf{Ganglia} : ...
\textbf{Nagios} : Could have a one-liner here so people knew I knew about it.
