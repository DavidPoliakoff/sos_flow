\section{Conclusion}
Given a diverse set of motivations for variability studies, and a
seemingly intractable problem space when classical performance models
are applied to scientific workflows at extreme scale, we argue that a
new performance model is required. SOSflow was developed to enable the
exploration and validation of new performance models, especially those
built for reasoning over high-level and human-understandable semantic
annotation that is affixed to all captured data and events.

\subsection{Recommendations}
Our research initiative is oriented towards on line and in situ
monitoring and analytics. A system should be designed that is
efficient enough that it need not be disabled for full-scale
production runs of scientific workflows. This creates the important
case that the lessons learned through the use of such a monitoring
system are in fact applicable to future full-scale production runs,
and do not only apply to smaller sample test runs where the workflow's
behavior has been heavily perturbed by invasive monitoring
technologies.  The conclusion goes here. this is more of the
conclusion
