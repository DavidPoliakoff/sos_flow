\begin{abstract} %------------------------------------------------------------%
SOS is a new model for the online in situ characterization and
analysis of complex high-performance computing applications.
%
SOS employs a data framework with distributed information management
and structured query and access capabilities.
%
The primary design objectives of SOS are flexibility, scalability, and
programmability.
%
SOS provides a complete framework that can be configured with and
used directly by an application, allowing for a detailed workflow
analysis of scientific applications.
%
This paper describes the model of SOS and the experiments used to
validate and explore the performance characteristics of its
implementation in SOSflow.
%
Experimental results demonstrate that SOS is capable of observation,
introspection, feedback and control of complex high-performance
applications, and that it has desirable scaling properties.
