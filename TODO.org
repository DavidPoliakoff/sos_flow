#+AUTHOR: Chad Wood

* BUGS
** DAEMON
   - Reannounce :: expansion of the pub on the daemon-side during a reannounce
        is not triggering.
   - SOSD_cloud_send :: off-node SOS cloud transport is sometimes eating data
        usually under heavy loads
        
* IMMEDIATE
   - DOCUMENTATION :: Write technical description and user's guide.
   - Instructions :: Provide guidance for GTech on EVPATH connector.

* MEDIUM
** DAEMON
    - SOSD_db :: clean up DB role to not be reconstructing entire memory
                 structure, but rather to reuse a scratch space to spool data
                 out to the database.
** CLIENT / LIB
    - Buffers :: Re-tool buffer-touching API signatures with max. buffer size
                 and make sure this is respected by the library functions.
    - Runtime :: Have SOS_init() return a SOS_runtime object for that layer
                 and adjust all SOS calls to take this SOS_runtime object
                 as a parameter for all calls, such that any layer of the
                 system is maintaining its own context.
    - Data Relationships :: Support for proposed relationship tracking.

** INTEGRATION
    - PARAVIEW :: Spin out SOSflow data into ParaView-supported offline
                  files on-command.


* LONG-RANGE
    - Internal error handling mechanism similar to event logs.
    - Refactor for C++ compatibiliy.

   - PAPER :: Focus on ~1 month out from now, Mar 15, 2016
   - FlexPath :: SET UP/ EMAIL ABOUT  up conference call with FlexPath developer

* PAPER NOTES
** SOSflow standalone paper
** MONA
